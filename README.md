Focus Areas:
I wanted to focus on a clean and attractive UI/UX as well as making sure the meet the expectations in the other areas.

Time Spent:
I spent 4 hours and 30 mins. Most of the time was spent on the UI. Slightly less was spent on the basic caching systems. I did not want to use a third party library. I put together a few Unit Tests to show basic ideas, but very little time was spent writing unit tests

Trade-offs and Decisions:
Normally in unit tests I would have stubs and mocks. I wouldn't be making actual network calls, but that was a trade-off I made. I would have liked to made the UI more interactive with collapsable sections and a search field.

Weakest Part of the Project:
I think the error handling and unit testing are the weakest parts of the project. I would prefer both to be more robust.

External Code and Dependencies:
None

Additional Information:
The total time taken was longer due to work and life constraints, but the time spent on the project remained limited.
